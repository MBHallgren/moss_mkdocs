## What is MOSS?

MOSS is a fully automated analytical tool which provides phylogeny analyses about clinical isolates.

## What does MOSS produce?
MOSS produces a pdf report about each isolates containing AMR genes, plasmids, virulence genes, mlst and much more.
Additionally, if any closely related isolates are found in the database a phylogeny analysis will be carried out.
All clinical data and metadata will be stored in an SQL database, thus allowing for multiuser surveillance of pathogens.
